# We use Basecamp for Ticket Repository.
we ask you to read whole texts onder this workflow folder to find the information you need to do a task.

1. [how to work, and how to find the document in BCでの作業・仕様の見つけ方](./HowToWorkInBC.md	)
2. [todoと、todolistと、projectの関係と、仕様の保持](https://github.com/toukubo/new_os/tree/master/OS/Conventions/RightPlaces/Levels.md#information-mapping-convention)


## Conventions: 
1. Post the ticket url to commit on the comments part. 
2. Set the due date of the tickets. our Progress Managers ( who does only this task ) will require this due date from you. 
3. It is important to the set due date on each tasks/to-do. By clicking your name on the right side , a calendar will appear in which you can select the date when you can complete the task assignment.
4. Estimate the time of the given task. provide the timeline/duration to complete each task/to-do by posting a comment ("discuss this file" tab) on the to-do. This time estimation will be used as a reference to calculate the cost when you send your invoice for payment purposes.
5. If task/to-do is completed, do not mark the to-do as completed. Use # string for tagging in order to chain the task. Sometimes we use tags, in order for the workflow to proceed to the next step. When the developer completes the task/to-do, the developer will have place a tag #to_be_tested or #releasing or whatever is appropriate for the next step. The tagging string should follow the form to start with #Create commit patch when you complete a todo. 
The most important rule is not to close (put a check mark) the task/to-do once the developer is finished with his task/to-do.   Instead, the developer needs to tag or assign to the tester and comment "for review/testing".

Administrators have a vital role in the organization. 
Their main task is to keep the Basecamp (BC) accounts of all projects up-to-date and to ensure that the people involved in the 
projects are engaged, and informed so that the projects can run smoothly and the deadlines are met.

               > Rename the event exactly the same as the to-do list
